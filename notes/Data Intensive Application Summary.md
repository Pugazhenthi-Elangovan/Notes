## <div align="center"> I. Foundation of Data Systems </div>

### 1. Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Applications

###### Reliability 
- Hardware faults, software errors, Human errors
##### Scalability
- Describing load 
	- Latencies
	- SLO's and SLA's
- Tail latency amplification 
- Horizontal/Vertical Scaling
- Elastic systems
- Rebalancing the partitions
- No magical scaling sauce
##### Maintainability
- Operability
- Simplicity
- Evolvability

### 2. Data Models and Query Languages
<i> "The limits of my language means the limits of my world" </i>

##### Abstraction of things/ represented in terms of next-lower layers
- App developer - Real world entities (People, Goods, Organisation, Actions)
 - Storage - JSON / XML / Tables / Graph Model
 - Database Engine - Bytes in Memory / Disk / Network
 - Hardware Engineers - Electrical currents, pulses, magnetic fields

##### Relational Model Vs Document Model
- The Birth of NoSQL - Not only SQL
- The Object-Relational MisMatch
- Many to one and Many Relationships
	- Normalization Vs Denormalization
- The Network Model
- Relational Vs Document Today
	- Which Data Model leads to simpler application code.
	- Schema flexibility
	- Data locality

##### Query Languages of Data
- Declarative Queries on the web
- MapReduce Querying

##### Graph Like Data Models
- Vertices and Edges - Many to Many Relationships
- Property Graphs
- The cypher query language - Neo4j
- Graph Queries in SQL
- Triple-Stores + The RDF data model - SPARQL

### 3. Storage and Retrieval

### 4. Encoding and Evolution
